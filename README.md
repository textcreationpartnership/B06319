#Two-penny-worth of wit for a penny. Or, The bad husband turn'd thrifty this man that wrought his own decay, and spent his money night and day; is turn'd to saving I do swear, there's few that with him can compare: and lves so civil in his ways, that all his neighbours give him praise, and does repent his wicked crime, and desires good fellows to turn in time; there's many a man runs himself clear out, when ale's in his head, then wit is out. To the tune of, Packingtons pound.#
